AI-Powered SQL Query Generator and Corrector
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that uses the Groq API and a PostgreSQL database to generate and correct SQL queries based on natural language input. It is designed to help users interact with databases using natural language and automatically correct SQL queries.

Features
Natural Language to SQL:

Translates natural language queries into SQL queries using the Groq API.
Supports complex queries involving multiple tables and conditions.
SQL Query Correction:

Corrects incorrect SQL queries based on the database schema and examples.
Database Integration:

Connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch schema information and validate queries.
Streamlit UI:

Provides an intuitive user interface for inputting natural language queries and viewing generated or corrected SQL queries.
